# CCDATSCL_COM221_PROJECT

Final project repository for a data science course. This project focuses on data ingestion, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and summarizing findings from weekly datasets.

## Project Name/Intro
This repository contains the final data science project work for the course. It consolidates multiple weekly datasets into a combined dataset and analyzes patterns using Jupyter notebooks.

## Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration
The project demonstrates practical data science workflow steps: data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and high-level interpretation of results for a course final.

## Getting Started/Requirements/Prerequisites/Dependencies
1. Create and activate a Python environment (Python 3.8+ recommended).
2. Install dependencies:
   - `pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
3. Start Jupyter:
   - `jupyter notebook`
4. Open the notebooks listed below to reproduce the preprocessing and analysis steps.

## Data
- `Datasets/Week_*/week_*.csv` contain the weekly source data files.
- `combined_player_data.csv` is the consolidated dataset produced during preprocessing.

## Project Structure
- `DataSci_Preprocessing.ipynb` performs data cleaning and merges weekly data.
- `Datasci_Analysis.ipynb` performs exploratory analysis and summarizes findings.
- `Datasets/` contains the raw weekly CSV files.

## Results/Deliverables
The notebooks document the end-to-end workflow and capture the final analysis for the course project.

## Contributing
This repository is a course final project and is not accepting external contributions.
